resume and portfolio of each candidate. But! If you are
already reading this line I'm pretty sure that you
became interested in my portfolio. So without
unnecessary dummy talking I'd rather provide you with
something about me, unless you want only a bare facts.
Then just click "My resume". Social cream is going to be

			<h2>Who am I exactly?</h2>
			<p className="is-style-text">
				I'm Chris, currently living in Otwock. I'm 24 years old and I
				have over a year of professional experience as a Frontend
				Developer. I believe the words "He's a man of focus, commitment,
				and sheer will" by John Wick describe me the best. When I take
				on something, my dedication is limitless, as evidenced by my
				polished projects that you can find on my GitHub. I consider the
				present as an investment in the future. My work doesn't end at 4
				p.m. cause there's always something worth learning! Am I a
				boring person then? It's possible, it's not for me to judge,
				although I don't have particularly refined interests. Apart from
				programming, I can include a love for movies and rock music
				among them. I can also talk about dog behavior due to my parents
				running a Maltese dog breeding business, so I've picked up some
				knowledge in the meantime. You'll find more details in my CV.

			<h2>How did I learned these things?</h2> <br />
			<p className="is-style-text">
				I started my programming journey a little over 3 years ago. One
				day, I stumbled upon a vlog with a catchy title that said, "You
				don't need to know math to become a programmer." And no, it
				wasn't a video from one of those companies that promises to turn
				you into a programmer in 3 months. After 3 months, I realized
				that taking notes in a notebook (i.e., transcribing code) was
				pointless. I am a self-taught programmer, and everything I know
				I owe to online courses, documentation, and above all, practice.

			<h2>Why should you hire me?</h2>
			<p className="is-style-text">
				I don't wanna answer the question above in a typical formulaic
				manner, such as saying that I'll be a loyal and dedicated
				programmer who will give my best. You probably hear that from
				everyone. Instead, I'll boldly say that I'm good at programming,
				and this is just the beginning of my career, so I haven't fully
				taken off yet. It's all in your hands, "With great power comes
				great responsibility!" and so on. Dear recruiter, if you've made
				it to the end of my ramblings, I want to sincerely thank you for
				your time (don't scan that QR code at the end of my portfolio).
