if you are a recruiter who's actually doing that. I've

resume and portfolio of each candidate. But! If you are
already reading this line I'm pretty sure that you
became interested in my portfolio. So without
unnecessary dummy talking I'd rather provide you with
something about me, unless you want only a bare facts.
Then just click my resume. Social cream is going to be

			<h2>Who am I exactly?</h2>
			<p className="is-style-text">
				My name is Chris, and I currently live in Otwock. I'm 22 and
				some people think that I'm a looser without a proper education.
				Despite this I don't think like that about myself and the proof
				of that is a place where I am currently in my life. By that I
				mean that I'm searching for my first job as a Junior Frontend
				Developer. When I'm into something I'm always get like 200% of
				my involvement which can be proven by my really polished
				projects that you can find later in my portfolio. I perceive my
				current activities as kind of investment in my future career. I
				go to work everyday but after that always try to spend my time
				to take out as many of my planned tasks as I can. I always plan
				my schedule up to 2 or 3 days ahead. Am I a boring person then?
				It's not for me to judge, though my interests are neither fancy
				nor sublime. Apart from programming I've got a romance with
				classical cinematography and rock music. I can also debate about
				dogs behaviorism since my parents have a breeding so I've
				learned a lot of things till now.

			<h2>How did I learned these things?</h2> <br />
			<p className="is-style-text">
				My journey with programming started about two years ago. One day
				I've accidentally came across a vlog on Youtube with big banner
				which said „You don't need math to become a programmer” and it
				wasn't a video of some company that will make you a programmer
				in just 3 months! After 3 months I found out that making notes
				(writing whole code in my notebook) is a little bit pointless.
				Back to the question above I am self-taught person and all of my
				skills are from courses, documentation but mostly from practice.
				To be honest my learning path probably looked similar like
				others. HTML, CSS → JavaScript → Framework (and tons of more or
				less useful things in between)

			<h2>Why should you hire me?</h2>
			<p className="is-style-text">
				My dear recruiter, if you have read all of my scribble I would
				like to thank you for your time! To be honest I don't wanna
				answer that question because I'm pretty sure that you know
				routine formula like „I am gonna be faithful and loyal
				programmer and promise to do my best”. Despite this I would say
				that I'm a human being who just wanna reset his life in some
				way, start everything from scratch in a new and friendly company
				by doing what I love the most. The Rest is on your hands so as
				they say „With great power comes great responsibility!”
