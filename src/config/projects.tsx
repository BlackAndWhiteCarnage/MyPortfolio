		description: `My parent's had a website but it was made by my father in some kind of website editor so... UI and UX wasn't really friendly and it looked like taken from 2000 year.

There is a couple of basic sections like: "About us", "Our dogs", "Exhibitions", "Buying process", "Faq" and of course "Contact". My main goal was to make it interesting and vivid. Personally I think that a good website is a website which will drill into your mind for a while.`,
